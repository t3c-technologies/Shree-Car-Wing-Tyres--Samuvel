            question: "How do I choose the right tyre size for my vehicle?",
            answer: "The tyre size is printed on the sidewall of your current tyres (e.g., 195/65 R15). You can also find this information in your vehicle's manual or on the placard inside the driver's door. Our experts can help you choose the perfect size and type for your driving needs."
        },
        {
            question: "What's the difference between different tyre types?",
            answer: "Passenger tyres are for regular cars and offer comfort and fuel efficiency. Performance tyres provide better handling and grip. All-terrain tyres work well on various surfaces. Commercial tyres are designed for heavy-duty use. We'll recommend the best type based on your vehicle and usage."
        },
        {
            question: "How often should I replace my tyres?",
            answer: "Typically, tyres should be replaced every 40,000-60,000 km or 3-5 years, depending on usage and conditions. Check for tread depth (should be above 1.6mm), visible wear indicators, cracks, or bulges. Our free tyre inspection can help determine if replacement is needed."
        },
        {
            question: "Do you provide installation services?",

        },
        {
            question: "What warranty do you offer on tyres?",
            answer: "All our tyres come with manufacturer warranty that covers manufacturing defects. The warranty period varies by brand and model (typically 2-5 years). We also provide our own service guarantee for installation and balancing work."
        },
        {
            question: "Can you help with tyre maintenance and repair?",
            answer: "Absolutely! We offer comprehensive tyre services including puncture repair, wheel alignment, wheel balancing, rotation, and pressure checks. Regular maintenance extends tyre life and improves vehicle safety and fuel efficiency."

        },
        {
            question: "What brands do you carry?",
            answer: "We are authorized dealers for premium brands including Apollo, Bridgestone, MRF, CEAT, JK Tyre, and more. We stock tyres for all vehicle types - 2-wheelers, cars, SUVs, commercial vehicles, and trucks. All products are genuine with proper warranty."
